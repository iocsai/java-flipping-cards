# java-flipping-cards
Java challenge from sololearn.com

You get a deck of cards with n cards. Then you turn every card, every second,
every third, every fourth and so on until you turn the n-th card. 
The question is how many cards are then face-up? I give you an example of 
a deck with 4 cards. 0 represents hidden and 1 means open

    0: 0 0 0 0 
    1: 1 1 1 1 
    2: 1 0 1 0 
    3: 1 0 0 0 
    4: 1 0 0 1 
  
So the answer for n = 4 would be two.

The code solves this puzzle for a general n.
Solved it mathematicaly also.
